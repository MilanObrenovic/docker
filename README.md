# 1. Getting Started

## 1.1. What Is Docker

![img.png](misc/docker.png)

- Platform for building, running and shipping applications.
- Developers can easily build and deploy applications running in **containers**.
- Container is like a running instance of our application, packaged up and running within a container.
- Local development is the same across any environment.
  - There are scenarios where the application may work on your local machine, but doesn't work on development, staging or production environment, because of hardware issues, installation problems etc.
  - Docker abstracts and solves all of those problems so that it always works on every environment and every machine.
- Docker is also used a lot for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) workflows.

## 1.2. Docker vs VM

### 1.2.1. Virtual Machine (VM)

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)** are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one **server** into **many servers**.
- The **hypervisor** allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine.
- Each VM includes a **full copy** of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries â€“ taking up tens of GBs.
- VMs can also be slow to boot, whereas with Docker containers are very fast to boot.

- Each VM consists of:
  - Infrastructure
  - Hypervisor
  - VM (application) running on a Linux OS (this can have multiple copies, each one running the application).

### 1.2.2. Docker

- Docker runs your applications in something called **containers**.
- **Containers** are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together.
- Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space.
- Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications and require fewer VMs and operating systems.

![img.png](misc/docker-2.png)
- Each container consists of:
  - Infrastructure
  - Host operating system
  - Docker
  - Application (which can have multiple copies).

### 1.2.3. Docker vs VM

![img.png](misc/docker-vs-vm.png)

- The key difference is the host operating system.
- VM has 3 copies while Docker only has 1.
- Therefore, we gain more performance using Docker.

### 1.2.4. The Difference

| Docker                           | VM                         |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Portable                         | Requires more memory       |
| Requires less memory             | Each VM runs on its own OS |
| All containers share the same OS | Startup time in minutes    |
| Startup time in milliseconds     | More secure                |
| Process level isolation          | Less popular these days    |
| Very popular                     |                            |

## 1.3. Installing Docker

- Install docker on https://docker.com/ and follow installation instructions.

## 1.4. Exploring Docker Dashboard

- **Containers / Apps tab:**
  - This is where the applications we built will be running.
  - Initially there shouldn't be anything listed.
- **Images tab:**
  - These are the images either on your local machine or remote repositories (Docker registries).
- **Volumes tab:**
  - This is used, so you can share data between host and containers.
- **Dev Environments:**
  - Define your project's configuration as code, distribute your project easily amongst your team, and have everyone work on the same code and any dependencies with one click.

## 1.5. Tools

Useful tools and resources to know and install that will be helpful in using Docker:
- Knowledge of: terminal, bash & Vim
- https://gitforwindows.org/ (Windows)
- https://cmder.app/
- https://iterm2.com/ (Mac)

## 1.6. Getting Started With Docker

1. Verify that Docker is installed:
```bash
docker --version
```
- This command should output the installed Docker version.
2. View all available Docker commands:
```bash
docker
```
3. Create a Hello World Docker application:
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
```
4. Navigate to the browser and check if Docker is now running on localhost:
```bash
http://localhost
```
5. List all running Docker processes:
```bash
docker ps
```
- There should be a `docker/getting-started` image process running.
6. Stop the container from running by targeting container ID:
```bash
docker stop 9919e467353a
```
7. Remove the entire docker container:
```bash
docker rm 9919e467353a
```
8. Pull and run a specific Docker image:
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 milanobrenovic/2048
```
9. Now test if a 2048 game is running on localhost:
```bash
http://localhost
```

# 2. Containers

## 2.1. Understanding Containers

### 2.1.1. Containers

![img_1.png](misc/containers-1.png)

- Container is an **isolated** environment for running applications.

![img.png](misc/containers-2.png)

- Contains everything your application needs, such as:
  - Operating system
  - Tools and binaries
  - And most importantly, software (spring boot, nodejs, golang, javascript, or whatever is the backend application built on)

![img_1.png](misc/containers-3.png)

- When you run the command `docker run` following the image name, that gave us the application deployed on Docker.

1. The command `docker ps` gives us a list of all running containers:
```bash
docker ps
```
- There should be 0 containers running.
2. Assuming there are no running containers, let's run the `milanobrenovic/2048` image:
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 milanobrenovic/2048
```
3. Now when you list all the Docker processes running:
```bash
docker ps
```
- There should be 1 running.
- Basically the process running here is a **container**.
4. Execute into the running container via interactive mode using container ID:
```bash
docker exec -it 4edc54e943c5 sh
```
5. Within the shell, list all the files and folders:
```bash
ls
```
6. Navigate to `nginx` directory:
```bash
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
```
7. By using `ls` in this directory, you can see all the files and folders uploaded via Docker which is then being run on http://localhost.

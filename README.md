# 1. Getting Started

## 1.1. What Is Docker

![img.png](misc/docker.png)

- Platform for building, running and shipping applications.
- Developers can easily build and deploy applications running in **containers**.
- Container is like a running instance of our application, packaged up and running within a container.
- Local development is the same across any environment.
  - There are scenarios where the application may work on your local machine, but doesn't work on development, staging or production environment, because of hardware issues, installation problems etc.
  - Docker abstracts and solves all of those problems so that it always works on every environment and every machine.
- Docker is also used a lot for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) workflows.

## 1.2. Docker vs VM

### 1.2.1. Virtual Machine (VM)

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)** are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one **server** into **many servers**.
- The **hypervisor** allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine.
- Each VM includes a **full copy** of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries â€“ taking up tens of GBs.
- VMs can also be slow to boot, whereas with Docker containers are very fast to boot.

- Each VM consists of:
  - Infrastructure
  - Hypervisor
  - VM (application) running on a Linux OS (this can have multiple copies, each one running the application).

### 1.2.2. Docker

- Docker runs your applications in something called **containers**.
- **Containers** are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together.
- Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space.
- Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications and require fewer VMs and operating systems.

- Each container consists of:
  - Infrastructure
  - Host operating system
  - Docker
  - Application (which can have multiple copies).

### 1.2.3. Docker vs VM

- The key difference is the host operating system.
- VM has 3 copies while Docker only has 1.
- Therefore, we gain more performance using Docker.

### 1.2.4. The Difference

| Docker                           | VM                         |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Portable                         | Requires more memory       |
| Requires less memory             | Each VM runs on its own OS |
| All containers share the same OS | Startup time in minutes    |
| Startup time in milliseconds     | More secure                |
| Process level isolation          | Less popular these days    |
| Very popular                     |                            |

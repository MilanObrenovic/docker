## 1.1. What Is Docker

![img.png](misc/docker.png)

- Platform for building, running and shipping applications.
- Developers can easily build and deploy applications running in **containers**.
- Container is like a running instance of our application, packaged up and running within a container.
- Local development is the same across any environment.
  - There are scenarios where the application may work on your local machine, but doesn't work on development, staging or production environment, because of hardware issues, installation problems etc.
  - Docker abstracts and solves all of those problems so that it always works on every environment and every machine.
- Docker is also used a lot for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) workflows.
